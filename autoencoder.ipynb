        "In this assignment, we will create a **simple autoencoder** model using the [TensorFlow subclassing API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras#model_subclassing). We start with the popular [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) (Grayscale images of hand-written digits from 0 to 9).\n",

        "\"Autoencoding\" is a data compression algorithm where the compression and decompression functions are 1) data-specific, 2) lossy, and 3) learned automatically from examples rather than engineered by a human. Additionally, in almost all contexts where the term \"autoencoder\" is used, the compression and decompression functions are implemented with neural networks.\n",
        " \n",
        " 1) Autoencoders are _data-specific_, which means that they will only be able to compress data similar to what they have been trained on. This is different from, say, the MPEG-2 Audio Layer III (MP3) compression algorithm, which only holds assumptions about \"sound\" in general, but not about specific types of sounds. An autoencoder trained on pictures of faces would do a rather poor job of compressing pictures of trees, because the features it would learn would be face-specific.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Autoencoders are _lossy_, which means that the decompressed outputs will be degraded compared to the original inputs (similar to MP3 or JPEG compression). This differs from lossless arithmetic compression.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Autoencoders are _learned automatically from data examples_, which is a useful property: it means that it is easy to train specialized instances of the algorithm that will perform well on a specific type of input. It doesn't require any new engineering, just appropriate training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To build an autoencoder, you need three things: an encoding function, a decoding function, and a distance function between the amount of information loss between the compressed representation of your data and the decompressed representation (i.e. a \"loss\" function). The encoder and decoder will be chosen to be parametric functions (typically neural networks), and to be differentiable with respect to the distance function, so the parameters of the encoding/decoding functions can be optimize to minimize the reconstruction loss, using Stochastic Gradient Descent. \n",
